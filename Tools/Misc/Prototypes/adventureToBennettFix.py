# ===== adventureToBennettFix (prototype v1) =====
#
# BennettAdventure -> Bennett: a multi-component SOURCE onto a classic single-component target, the
# inverse of bennettAdventureFix.py. A copy of tranquilToYelanFix.py with this pair's tables; the
# machinery from "the lightmap bands" down is that script's, including its buffer MERGE -- the
# design note at the top of it is the one to read for why the components are concatenated into one
# buffer set and one .ini file rather than given one .ini each.
#
#   py -3 adventureToBennettFix.py <mod folder>                     fix every BennettAdventure .ini under the folder
#   py -3 adventureToBennettFix.py <mod folder> --components Body   only some source components
#   py -3 adventureToBennettFix.py <mod folder> --keepBackups       keep the .ini backups the API makes
#   py -3 adventureToBennettFix.py <mod folder> --verbose           attach the API's logger
#   py -3 adventureToBennettFix.py <mod folder> --noTextures        geometry only, light maps untouched
#
# ---- What lands where (measured 2026-09-14, not read off the slot names) ----
#
# Every draw isolated out of the two frame analyses taken today -- each draw's render target minus
# the one before it -- because the names say nothing (YelanTranquil's "Body B" turned out to be her
# jewellery). What the four source slots actually draw:
#
#   Adventure Body A  14778 tris  torso, arms, hands, jacket, back hair  -> Bennett body  (9879)
#   Adventure Body B  13073 tris  legs, trousers, boots                  -> Bennett body  (9879)
#   Adventure Bang     3128 tris  the front fringe                       -> Bennett head  (0)
#   Adventure Eye       276 tris  the eyes                               -> Bennett head  (0)
#
# Bennett's own two draws, for comparison: head = the fringe and his goggles, body = everything else
# including his face and cape.
#
# So BOTH pairs collapse: A and B onto his body, the Bang and the Eye onto his head. Yelan had only
# the one pair (Bang + Eye -> head); here the machinery's "two slots may name the same target object,
# their index buffers are concatenated into one draw" runs twice.
#
# ---- The register layout ----
#
# Bennett's own draws are all the no-normal-map shader 95aa6cdb84eb7b99 (draws 40 and 41), so every
# remapped object is the two-register NNFix layout: ps-t0 diffuse, ps-t1 light map. The source's
# Body A, Body B and Bang read a normal map on ps-t0, so for those the normal map is DROPPED and the
# rest shifted down (ps-t1 -> ps-t0, ps-t2 -> ps-t1) -- the GanyuTwilight -> Ganyu shape. Her Eye is
# already the plain layout (95aa6cdb84eb7b99, the same shader as Bennett's own draws) and is left
# alone.
#
# The face diffuse needs no register change, only the hash: BOTH characters bind it at ps-t1 with
# the face light map d4841e1a at ps-t0 (main draws 42/43/46/47/52/53 on the skin, 37/38/39 on
# Bennett). Same as the Yelan pair.
#
# ---- The light map bands: nothing moves, and that is measured ----
#
# A GIMI light map's alpha is a material band selecting a shading ramp, and the legend is per skin,
# so the Yelan pair needed three bands moved. This pair needs none. Histogrammed off both sides'
# own textures (alpha counts with the mean diffuse under each band):
#
#   Adventure Body A   0 (35%) | 78 | 126-128 | 177-178 (30%, pale 213/208/196) | 255 SKIN (233/203/180, 100% skin-coloured)
#   Adventure Body B   0 (48%, orange 188/135/79) | 78 (26%, blue 35/76/98) | 126-128 | 176-178 | NO 255 band
#   Bennett body       0 (77%, dark cloth) | 126-128 (white trim, 242/241/236) | 255 SKIN (232/204/181, 99.5%)
#   Bennett head       0 (85%, pale 215/209/197) | 255 (13.5%, dark 102/105/71)
#
# The one band that can be identified on both sides -- skin -- is already at 255 on both, with the
# diffuse means agreeing to within 1/255 per channel. Every other band of the source has no
# identifiable counterpart in Bennett's legend, and moving one on a guess is not a no-op: it puts a
# value on a ramp that means something else, which is how the Yelan run put static on her neck. So
# Bands is EMPTY until something in game says otherwise, and the mod's light maps pass through.
#
# ---- The vertex group rows ----
#
# Shipped in data/VGRemapData.cpp as of this session: BennettAdventure Body (106 groups), Bang (9)
# and Eye (2) onto Bennett. Proposed by Tools/VGRemapFinder from the geometry and NOT yet confirmed
# in game -- Bennett has no hand-made draft to score against.
#
# The mirror-pair check that found YelanTranquil's warped knee was run on these and they PASS: of 59
# mirror pairs in the Body, exactly one collapses onto a single target bone (69 and 70 -> Bennett 4)
# and that bone is on the midline (X +0.000), so neither side is dragged across. VGRemapFixes is
# therefore empty, where the Yelan prototype needed an override.
