The C++ half of the command-line front end for a remap

:raw-html:`<br />`

:class:`RemapService` is the model -- it takes already-typed data and knows nothing about where its
output goes. This class is the other side of that line: the view it reports through, and the log
file that output is written to

.. note::
    :meth:`addTips` is an **empty hook** here on purpose. A tip names a command-line option, and
    those belong to the argument parser, which is not in C++. Subclass this and override it -- which
    is exactly what the Python :class:`RemapServiceCLI` does

There are **two** ways to build one, and which you want depends on what you are holding

:raw-html:`<br />`

**From strings** -- what an argument parser produced. This is the one ``main.py`` uses, and it takes
the same arguments the pure-Python :class:`RemapService` did: ``path``, ``keepBackups``, ``fixOnly``,
``undoOnly``, ``hideOrig``, ``readAllInis``, ``types``, ``defaultType``, ``forcedType``, ``log``,
``verbose``, ``handleExceptions``, ``version``, ``fromVersion``, ``remappedTypes``, ``proxy``,
``downloadMode`` and ``gameTypes`` and ``compressTextures``. ``version`` is the version being
fixed **to** -- the pure-Python API's own meaning -- and ``fromVersion`` the one the mods were
written for; they select the fixer and the parser respectively and are independent. Mod type and game names/aliases become
:class:`ModTypeId`/:class:`GameTypeId` ints (ignoring case and surrounding whitespace), a
`PEP 440`_ string becomes a :class:`Version`, and a mode name becomes a :class:`DownloadMode`

.. note::
    Naming **no** types (or **no** games) -- ``None`` or an empty list -- means *every* one of them,
    not none of them. That is the opposite of what an empty set means on
    :attr:`RemapService.fromModTypeIds`/:attr:`RemapService.gameTypeIds`, and this constructor is
    where the ambiguity gets resolved

.. note::
    A string that resolves to nothing does **not** raise from the constructor. It is stored, and
    :meth:`fix` raises it -- see :attr:`hasErrorsBeforeFix`

:raw-html:`<br />`

**From an already-built model** -- ``service``, ``log``, ``verbose``. For a caller that has a
:class:`RemapService` in hand and only wants the log file and the reporting around it. The service's
``logger`` is overwritten with this object's own

:raw-html:`<br />`

In both, ``log`` is the **folder** to write the log file into, or ``None`` for no log -- the file's
own name is always ``RemapFixLog.txt`` and is never the caller's. ``verbose`` is independent of it:
a quiet run can still write a full log file

noise on top of a run that already went wrong
