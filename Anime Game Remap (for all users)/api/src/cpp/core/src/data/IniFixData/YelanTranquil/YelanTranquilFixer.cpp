        //                          | 165-189 teal silk | no 255 band at all

        //   Yelan Body/Dress       0 hair and dark cloth | 64-89 metal | 115-128 SKIN (244,224,206)

        // They are applied SIMULTANEOUSLY -- every decision is made from the ORIGINAL alpha -- because
        // they are a permutation: 0 -> 255 -> 121 -> ... would otherwise chase itself.

        // Each move is conditioned on the DIFFUSE under the pixel, for the reason the forward
        // direction found the hard way: a mod need not follow its character's legend at all, because
        // a PORT keeps its SOURCE character's bands.
        //
        // One asymmetry with the forward direction worth knowing: there the fur move is
        // unconditional, because Yelan's 255 is never Tranquil-legend skin. Here it cannot be, since
        // the band in question is 0 -- the DEFAULT a lazy or ported mod leaves everything on -- and
        // Yelan's own band 0 is her hair-and-all-cloth band, i.e. the safe no-op. So band 0 moves to
        // her fur only where the diffuse actually looks like white fur.
        // Read as a MaterialBandRemapFilter table: source band (or range) -> target band, gated on
        // the diffuse under the pixel. The filter applies them SIMULTANEOUSLY -- every decision
        // from the ORIGINAL alpha -- which is what these three need, since they are a permutation
        // and in sequence a permutation chases itself.
