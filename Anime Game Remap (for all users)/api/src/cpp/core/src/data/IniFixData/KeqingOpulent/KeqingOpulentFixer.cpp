         * The two colour bands KeqingOpulent's head lightmap uses to mark a surface as reflective.
         *
         * A lightmap is not a picture: each channel is a material parameter, and the alpha channel
         * is the one the shader reads as "how much does this reflect". The magenta band is the
         * metal trim, the olive band the lacquered hair ornament. Keqing has neither, so the
         * remapped model ends up with a mirror finish on flat cloth.
         *
         * Forcing those pixels opaque is what switches the reflection off -- hence the resource
         * name the fix writes, NonReflectiveLightMap.
         *
         * The alpha bound of 254 on each maximum is deliberate and is copied from the pure-Python
         * row: a pixel that is ALREADY fully opaque is left out of the match, since adjusting it
         * would be a no-op anyway.
