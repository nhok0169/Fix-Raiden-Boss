        //
        // Her diffuse sits on ps-t1 and her lightmap on ps-t2, one slot up, because ps-t0 is her
        // normal map (see LisaStudentParser, and HashData's note on that row). Lisa reads the
        // modern layout, so the whole thing shifts DOWN on the way across:
        //
        //     ps-t0  normal map  -> dropped, Lisa has none
        //     ps-t1  diffuse     -> ps-t0

        // RegValChecks on them -- move ps-t1 only if it looks like a diffuse, drop ps-t0 only if
        // it looks like a normal map -- so that a mod already in the modern layout would not be
        // shifted twice. That guards on the wrong thing: RegValChecks reads the RESOURCE NAME,
        // which the modder picks and which a mod ported forward keeps long after the content
        // behind it has moved. LisaStudent1 binds ps-t0 to a section called
        // 'ResourceLisaStudentHeadDiffuse' that holds her NORMAL MAP. The register position is
        // the contract; the name is a label.
        //
        // ALL THREE TARGETS, including the dress. The dress is the second copy of the body
        // graph that the split makes, so it arrives with the same registers bound the same way
        // -- and objRegRemovals/objRegRemaps are keyed by TARGET, so leaving it out shifted the
        // body copy and left the dress copy exactly as it came in. Half the model in one layout
        // and half in the other, which no section-name diff can see.
