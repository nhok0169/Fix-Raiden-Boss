         * types a GIMI mod actually writes as a section's "hash = " line -- the ib, the three
         * vertex buffers, and the draw hash the VertexLimitRaise sections carry -- so they are
         * the only ones the classifier can see at all. And, measured over the whole of
         * HashData, they are UNIQUE: across 357 rows not one of their values is claimed by two
         * different characters.
         *
         * The texture hashes are the opposite and must stay out. A shadow ramp or a metal map
         * is a shared asset: 'b0e08915' is filed under FORTY different names and '7eb5b84e'
         * under thirty-three, so registering those would hand a +2 vote to forty characters for
         * one line of a mod's .ini -- noise loud enough to decide a classification on its own.
         * Even 'tex_face_diffuse', which does appear as a section hash, is shared in 27 of its
         * 45 rows.
