    /**
     * @brief
     @rst
     The command-line front end for a remap -- the **UI** half of what the pure-Python
     ``RemapService`` used to be :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     :cpp:class:`RemapService` is the model: it takes already-typed data (:cpp:enum:`ModTypeId`
     integers, a parsed :cpp:class:`Version`, a :cpp:enum:`DownloadMode`) and knows nothing about
     where its output goes. This class is everything on the other side of that line -- the view it
     reports through, the log file that output is written to, and (as they are added) turning what a
     user typed into the data the model wants :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     **Holds** a :cpp:class:`RemapService` rather than deriving from one. The model stays completely
     unaware there is a CLI, and #service is public so the caller can reach every one of its
     attributes without this class forwarding them by hand :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     .. note::
        Argument parsing is deliberately **not** here. The pure-Python driver (``main.py``) parses
        the command line and hands the results in, and that split is kept: this class takes values,
        not an ``argv``. It is why the option *names* a tip would quote (``--revert`` and friends)
        are not in this class either -- they belong with the parser that defines them

     .. note::
        Written from the pure-Python ``RemapService``'s own ``createLog``/``log`` handling
        (``remapService.py``), which is where the log-file behaviour below comes from

             Constructs a front end from what a user **typed** -- the string half of the pure-Python
             ``RemapService``'s own constructor :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Every parameter that :cpp:class:`RemapService` takes as already-typed data
             (:cpp:enum:`ModTypeId` integers, a :cpp:class:`Version`, a :cpp:enum:`DownloadMode`)
             arrives here as the text an argument parser produced, and is converted. Everything
             already unambiguous as a `bool` or a path is passed straight through :raw-html:`<br />`
             :raw-html:`<br />`

             **A bad string does not throw from here.** The first conversion failure is stored and
             raised by #fix instead -- see #hasErrorsBeforeFix for why. So is the pure-Python
             original's own behaviour :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             .. note::
                'gameTypes' is converted here like every other name/alias, through
                :cpp:func:`GameTypeIdTools::findByName`. That was not always true -- there was a
                time when nothing resolved a game by name at all and this took only the id

             .. note::
                An empty list means *no filter* here, exactly as ``std::nullopt`` does -- it is the
                pure-Python original's own reading, and the only one an argument parser can produce
                (a user who names no types wants all of them, not none). That is why this differs
                from :cpp:member:`RemapService::fromModTypeIds`, where an empty **set** is a filter
                that accepts nothing: by then the ambiguity has been resolved, and this is where it
                is resolved

             Only ever in play when 'readAllInis' is on and no 'forcedType' was given -- otherwise
             there is either nothing unclassified to fall back for, or a forced type already
             answering the question. Left unset with 'readAllInis' on, it is ``Raiden``, which is

             :raw-html:`<br />`

             Named ``version`` rather than ``toVersion`` because that is what the pure-Python API
             called it, and what ``--version`` has always meant on the command line
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Separate from ``version`` on purpose. It picks the PARSER and the hashes/indices the
             mod is read with, where ``version`` picks the FIXER, and the two are independent --
             every shipped fix row is keyed from ``1.0`` whatever version it fixes to. One option
             feeding both, which is what this class did for a day, makes a divergence at a
             historical version impossible to attribute to one selection or the other
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             :raw-html:`<br />`

             Unset means :cpp:enumerator:`DownloadMode::Normal`. The pure-Python original named a

             A tip is a sentence like "run this script again using the ``--undo`` option", and those

             the layer that owns the parser overrides it :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Called by #fix after the remap and **before** #createLog, so the tips land in the log
             file too, and only when :cpp:func:`RemapService::noErrors` -- advice about what to try
             next is noise on top of a run that already went wrong. That ordering and that gate are
             the pure-Python original's own

             Prints the banner naming which types of mods this run will fix :raw-html:`<br />`
             :raw-html:`<br />`

             Reads :cpp:member:`RemapService::fromModTypeIds` and prints one bullet per type, sorted
             by NAME rather than by id, so the list reads alphabetically instead of in whatever order
             the ids happen to fall in :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             The two empty cases are **not** the same thing, and this is the one place a user sees
             the difference: ``std::nullopt`` is "no filter" and prints *All mods*, while a
             present-but-empty set accepts nothing and prints *No mods*. The pure-Python original had
             only one empty (a falsy list) and printed *All mods* for it :raw-html:`<br />`
             :raw-html:`<br />`

                Called at the top of #fix, where the pure-Python original called it at the end of its
                **constructor**. Deliberate: a virtual call from a constructor does not reach an
                override, so a subclass reshaping this banner -- the whole reason it is virtual --
                would silently never be used. Running it from #fix costs nothing else, since the
                driver constructs and then immediately fixes
