     * @brief
     @rst
     A factory that builds the :cpp:class:`BaseIniParser` for one ``.ini`` file, optionally picking
     *which* parser (and with which arguments) based on the mod's name and the game version the
     ``.ini`` file came from :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The C++ counterpart to the pure-Python ``IniParseBuilder``
     (``model/strategies/iniParsers/IniParseBuilder.py``), and what
     :cpp:member:`ModType::iniParseBuilder` holds. It comes in the same two flavours the original
     does:

     * **Fixed** -- one #Factory used for every ``.ini`` file, whatever its version. The equivalent
       of the original's ``IniParseBuilder(GIMIParser)``
     * **Version-dependent** -- an #ArgsRepo looked up by ``(modName, version)`` on every #build,
       so a 5.7-era ``.ini`` file of some mod gets a different parser (or a differently-configured
       one) than a 4.0-era one. The equivalent of the original's
       ``IniParseBuilder(ModDataAssets.IniParseBuilderArgs.value)``

     :raw-html:`<br />`

     .. note::
        The pure-Python original stores a ``(cls, args, kwargs)`` triple and splats it at build
        time, because Python has no other way to carry "a constructor with some of its arguments
        already chosen". C++ does -- a closure -- so the whole triple collapses into the single
        #Factory callable, with the arguments captured rather than stored alongside a class object.
        A row the original writes as ``(GIMIObjParser, [{"head", "body"}], {...})`` is written here
        as a lambda returning ``std::make_shared<GIMIObjParser>(iniFile, ...)``, and is type-checked
        at compile time instead of at build time

     .. note::
        There is deliberately no equivalent of the original's ``@lru_cache(maxsize = 64)`` on
        ``_getBuilderArgs``. That cache exists to avoid re-running an argument-*generator* function
        against a linear-scanning lookup table; here the lookup is :cpp:func:`ModDictAssets::get`
        (a hash lookup plus a binary search) and the #Factory it finds is already built, so there
        is nothing left to memoize. The observable behaviour still matches: whatever a row's lambda
        **captures** is constructed once and shared across every build, exactly as the
        ``lru_cache``\\d triple's argument objects are, while the parser itself is freshly
        constructed per call

             this class's own note on why that collapses into a single callable here. The
             :cpp:class:`IniFile` argument is what the original's ``Builder.build(iniFile)`` passes
             positionally to the parser's constructor; it may be ``nullptr``, since

             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Two index columns, matching that original's own ``["version", "name"]``: the game
             version at position ``0``, and the mod's name at position ``1``. A version resolves by
             inclusive floor-match (see :cpp:func:`ModDictAssets::get`), which is what makes "the

             Held by ``shared_ptr`` because one table is shared by every :cpp:class:`ModType` of a
             game (all 47 GI mod types share a single one, exactly as the pure-Python original's own

             side having no ``Yelan`` -- share a single ``IniParseBuilderArgs`` instance)
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             If this is ``nullptr``, the builder degrades to the #defaultFactory-only behaviour of

             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             * ``false`` (the default) -- fall back to #defaultFactory, so one unlisted mod type
               degrades to a plain parser rather than aborting the run. This matches how the rest
               of this pipeline handles a missing strategy (:cpp:func:`IniFile::parse` skips a mod
               type with no parser, :cpp:func:`IniFile::fix` skips one with no fixer) rather than
               the pure-Python original, whose ``ModAssets.get`` defaults to
               ``errorOnNotFound = True`` and raises
             * ``true`` -- let :cpp:func:`ModDictAssets::get`'s ``std::out_of_range`` propagate,
               matching the pure-Python original exactly

             :raw-html:`<br />`

             .. note::
                This only covers a mod name with **no row at any version**. A mod name that has a
                row at some older version always resolves (to that older row) for every later
                version, by :cpp:class:`ModDictAssets`'s floor-match -- the same way the
                pure-Python table's 4.0 entries cover every version after 4.0
