     Merges a multi-component mod's buffers onto a single-component target, as a fix over a group of
     resources -- the inverse of :cpp:func:`fixVGSplitGroup` :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The buffers cannot be fixed one at a time: every component's index buffer shifts by the vertices
     of the components before it, so an index buffer written without knowing the others is wrong. So
     the members are fixed together, from the one :cpp:class:`VGComponentMerge` :raw-html:`<br />`
     :raw-html:`<br />`

     Members are told apart by :cpp:member:`IniResource::type`, exactly as the split does it:
     ``blend``, ``position`` and ``texcoord`` (at most one each -- the merged buffer is bound to the
     target's single hash) and ``buf`` (the index buffers, matched to
     :cpp:member:`VGMergeObject::srcPath`). A target object whose component sits at offset 0 and
     draws one source object needs no member at all: its index buffer is already right
