     * @brief
     @rst
     This class inherits from :cpp:class:`BaseIniGraphEdit`

     Adds a `KVP`_ into some caller/callee graph of :cpp:class:`IniSectionGraph` **exactly once
     per delimiter-free stretch of every execution path** -- or, in
     :cpp:enumerator:`RegDelimitedAddMode::PerPath`, exactly once per execution path
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     Read :cpp:enum:`RegDelimitedAddMode` before choosing: an addition whose effect ACCUMULATES
     (GIMI's ``NNFix`` / ``ORFix``, which re-slot the ``ps-t`` registers and so undo themselves when
     called twice) needs ``PerPath``, and the segment rule below silently renders every second draw
     of a multi-draw `section`_ unfixed :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The rest of this description is the ``PerSegment`` rule; ``PerPath``'s is at the end
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     Cut every execution path through the graph at each accepted occurence of a register in
     \ref delimiterRegs. That leaves `segments`: from the start of the path to its first
     delimiter, from each delimiter to the next, and from the last delimiter to the end of the
     path. This edit places \ref additions so that **every segment of every path contains it
     exactly once, as late as possible**, which it does with two placement rules:

     1. immediately before every accepted delimiter occurence, in every part, and
     2. at the end of every `path-terminal` part -- a part after which nothing more executes on
        its path (its :cpp:func:`CallGraph::exitNodeOf` node has no successor: the end of a
        `section`_ that no other section ``run``\\s)

     Both are exact by construction. A pre-delimiter insertion is followed on every path by its
     own delimiter, so it can only ever sit in a segment that ends at that delimiter; a path-end
     insertion has nothing after it, so a path crosses at most one, and every path crosses exactly
     one. No `fixpoint iteration`_, no once-per-window claiming: the whole edit is one walk
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The motivating case is a texture fix (``NNFix``/``ORFix``) that must be issued right before
     every ``drawindexed`` it applies to, and issued once more -- but never twice in a row -- at the
     end of a path that renders nothing:

     .. code-block:: ini

        a = 1
        if $x == 2
           insertion = NNFix      ; before the draw
           drawindexed = a
        else
          foo = 2                 ; nothing here -- the shared end below covers this path
        endif
        b = 3
        insertion = NNFix         ; once, at the end of both paths

     .. note::
        Do not reach for :cpp:class:`RegSurroundedAdd` for this rule -- that edit inserts once per
        `surrounded` **window** across the graph, so two delimiters in sequence get a single
        insertion before the last of them, and no combination of its options reproduces the
        per-segment invariant above

     .. note::
        ``run =`` is modeled as `call-with-return`_: the end of a called `section`_ is not a path
        end, its caller continues afterwards, so the trailing insertion lands in the caller. The
        one case this cannot get exactly right is a `section`_ that is **both** a root and a
        ``run`` target: its end is a path end when reached directly but not when called, and a
        single physical position cannot serve both. Such a section gets **no** trailing insertion
        -- by choice, this edit never doubles the addition, at the cost of missing it on that
        section's direct path. Real mods do not ``run`` their hash-triggered sections, so this does
        not arise in practice

     A \ref BaseIniGraphEdit::PartFilter given to \ref edit gates each candidate position on its
     own (a position the filter's ranges do not contain is simply skipped, never relocated), so a
     filter that excludes the only valid position of a segment breaks the invariant for that
     segment -- the filter is the caller's statement that the part must not be touched there
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     **The** ``PerPath`` **rule.** Only the FIRST segment of each path is given the addition, so a
     path receives it once however many times it delimits. The position is still as late as
     possible, which is the frontier of the region no delimiter can have executed before:

     1. a part that can be reached with nothing delimited yet, **on every path that reaches it**, is
        a candidate -- the candidates form a prefix of the graph, and every path leaves that prefix
        exactly once;
     2. a candidate holding a delimiter takes the addition immediately before its FIRST one;
     3. a candidate holding none takes it at its END, but only when it has to -- when it is a path
        end, or when one of its successors is NOT a candidate (some path leaves the prefix there
        without delimiting, and nothing further along could serve it);
     4. otherwise it defers to its successors, and once a part has taken the addition everything
        reachable from it is covered and takes none.

     Rule 3 is what a `section`_ whose draws are all inside INDEPENDENT ``if`` blocks needs -- there
     is no position inside the blocks that serves the paths through the other blocks, so the
     addition lands at the end of the header content, which is exactly where a mod author writes it
     by hand. Rule 4 is what stops that same `section`_ from also taking one inside each block
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     \ref pathEndOnlyWhenUndelimited is IGNORED in this mode: "once at the end of a path that never
     delimits" is what rules 1-3 already do

             ``false`` (the default) is the plain segment rule: every delimiter-free segment holds
             the addition, the last one -- from the final delimiter to the end of the path --
             included.

             ``true`` drops that final segment, giving "before every delimiter, **or** once at the
             end if there is no delimiter anywhere on the path". That is what the mandatory fix
             libraries want: NNFix and ORFix belong immediately before each draw, and a call after
             the last draw is a surplus one that ORFix would use to swap the diffuse and lightmap
             registers back. A graph with no draw call at all still gets its single addition, which
             is what places NNFix on a character whose fix does not move the draw call
