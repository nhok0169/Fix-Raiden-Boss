             Deliberately not an :cpp:class:`Indices` row, for the reason ``IndexData.cpp``'s own
             note records: :cpp:func:`ModMappedAssets::getKey` buckets every row holding a value by
             version and searches only the newest bucket at or below the version asked, so a slot
             filed as ``"0"`` at 5.7 would make the 5.7 bucket THE bucket for ``"0"`` and every
             classic character's head -- index 0, filed at 4.0 -- would reverse-resolve to a slot
             named ``A`` and fall out of its own parser. So the classifier here resolves a slot from
             this literal, per component, rather than through the table

             A GIMI ``TextureOverride`` binds registers for the draw call its hash matches and no
             other, so a slot whose own `section`_ declares no ``ps-t`` renders with whatever the

             donor here is what lets those textures be DOWNLOADED rather than read out of the mod
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Measured over five YelanTranquil mods: three of them leave a slot textureless, and
             reading the mod's donor instead put a repainted atlas under the game's texture
             coordinates -- one mod's hair and another's eyes came out sampling other islands
             entirely (2026-09-14)

             Not the same as the skin's own name: each component of a multi-component skin is a
             :cpp:enum:`ModTypeId` of its own so the forward direction can target it, and its hashes
             live under that name. This is why one classifier per component is needed rather than one
             for the parser: a single hash filter can only name one of them

     Builds the parser for a mod of a skin made of SEVERAL components :raw-html:`<br />`
     :raw-html:`<br />`

     :cpp:func:`makeGIMICharParser` cannot express one: its mod objects are all ``("", obj)``, its
     index map has the single key ``ib``, and its hash filter names one mod type -- while a
     multi-component skin files each component's hashes under that COMPONENT's mod type name. So this
     builds **one classifier per component**, each filtered to its own name, and a section is offered
     to each in turn; a hash value is unique to one character, so at most one answers
     :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The mod objects it produces are ``(component, kind)`` -- ``("Body", "blend")``,
     ``("Bang", "position")`` -- and ``(component, slot)`` for a drawn object, which is what lets a
     fixer address one component's buffers without touching another's. The ``match_first_index`` of a
     drawn object is resolved from :cpp:member:`GIMIComponentParserConfig::Slot::index` rather than
     through :cpp:class:`Indices`; see there for why
