         * @brief
         @rst
         The vertex group remap table backing :cpp:class:`VGRemaps` -- the C++-side counterpart to the
         pure-Python ``VGRemapData`` (``data/VGRemapData.py``) :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         Rows are ``({fromVersion, fromChar, fromComp, toVersion, toChar, toComp}, remap)`` -- **six**
         index columns, of which **two** (``fromVersion`` at position 0 and ``toVersion`` at position
         3) are version columns :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         .. note::
            That two-version-column shape is what sets this table apart from every other one in
            ``data/``. The hash, index, vertex-count and builder-args tables all have exactly one
            version column and so are :cpp:class:`ModDictAssets`; this one cannot be, and
            :cpp:class:`VGRemaps` uses :cpp:class:`ModAssets` instead -- see that class

         .. note::
            The value is a whole :cpp:class:`VGRemap` object, not a scalar -- 58 rows carrying 5542
            index pairs between them (measured 2026-09-13)

         .. note::
            ``fromComp`` and ``toComp`` are ``""`` on all but six rows -- the ``Yelan`` <->
            ``YelanTranquil`` remap, which is per-component (``Body``, ``Bang``, ``Eye``) in both
            directions and so is the first thing to use these two columns for real. An empty
            component is still a real key value, not a "missing" marker, exactly as with the
            component columns in :cpp:func:`Data::getIndexDataRows` and
            :cpp:func:`Data::getVertexCountDataRows`

         .. danger::
            Mechanically generated from the real, live pure-Python data (never hand-transcribed -- a
            script imported the actual module, ran ``vgRemapDataBuilder.build()`` and walked the
            resulting 6-deep dict), then verified row-for-row and pair-for-pair against it. Future
            remap updates edit :cpp:func:`getVGRemapDataRows`'s literal directly (see
            ``VGRemapData.cpp``) :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

            **The two have since diverged on purpose: this table has six rows the pure-Python one
            does not** -- the ``Yelan`` <-> ``YelanTranquil`` remap was added here only, so
            ``vgRemapDataBuilder.build()`` still yields 52 rows / 5229 pairs against this table's 58
            / 5542. So this table can no longer be regenerated from that builder: doing so would
            silently drop Yelan. The same caveat :cpp:func:`Data::getVertexCountDataRows` carries
