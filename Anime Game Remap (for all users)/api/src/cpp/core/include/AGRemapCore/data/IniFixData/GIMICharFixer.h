         graph emitted once per target object, each carrying that object's own hash and
         ``match_first_index``) or a **merge** (several source graphs landing on one target object)

         Each entry is one old register and the register(s) it becomes. Naming **two** targets

         What it is for: GI 3.x gave characters a **normal map**, and GI 6.x took it away again.
         Remapping across that boundary is a shift -- a character with no normal map has its diffuse
         on ``ps-t0`` and its lightmap on ``ps-t1``, one with a normal map has them on ``ps-t1`` and
         ``ps-t2`` with the normal map on ``ps-t0`` :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         All of an object's renames are applied in **one pass**, so a shift and a swap are both

         The textures this fix creates from scratch --- **empty by default**, which is the
         common case :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         What it is for: remapping ACROSS the normal-map boundary in the direction that **gains**
         one. GI 3.x gave characters a normal map on ``ps-t0``; a source that predates that has
         nothing to put there, so the fix invents a flat one. Ganyu -> GanyuTwilight is the
         worked example, and it is the exact mirror of GanyuTwilight -> Ganyu, which instead
         **drops** ``ps-t0`` through \ref objRegRemovals :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         Pair it with \ref objRegRemaps. The shift has to duplicate the diffuse into the slot it
         is moving to *and* leave it where it was, so this has something to overwrite:
         ``{{"head", {{"ps-t0", {"ps-t0", "ps-t1"}}, {"ps-t1", {"ps-t2"}}}}}``

         .. note::
            Ordering is handled for you: the collectors run before the register edits, so a
            texture is declared against the register it hangs off **before** the shift, not
            after. See ``buildTexEdits``

         :raw-html:`<br />`

         A position buffer holds where the mesh's vertices ARE, and remapping a mod onto
         another character does not move them. Of the 47 pairs in the pure-Python
         ``PositionEditorData`` table, 46 are ``None``; the exception is a pair whose two models
         were authored around different origins, and Xiangling/XianglingCheer are that pair --
         about 0.78 units apart in Y, so a mod remapped between them lands in mid-air unless
         every vertex is translated to match :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

         Set it and the fix writes a ``[Resource<Mod><Target>RemapPosition.N]`` beside the
         blend's and repoints ``vb0`` at it; leave it and nothing about the position is touched,
         not even a renamed copy

         wrong register. It has no pure-Python equivalent, so a transcribed row never asks for
         it and the old script never produces it -- which is exactly what an A/B at

         It is true by default because the fix re-issues those calls itself, in the one place

         Set it false for a fix transcribed from a PRE-6.x row. In the pure-Python original this
         removal is not framework behaviour at all -- it is per-row configuration, a
         ``RegRemove(*ORFixCompleteRemoval)`` that every 6.1 row carries and no 4.0 row does. A
         historical row re-issues nothing, so leaving the removal on deletes the modder's own
         call and puts nothing back: RosariaCN's head section at ``--version 4.0``, where the old
         script keeps ``run = CommandList\\global\\ORFix\\NNFix`` and this dropped it (2026-09-13)

         .. note::
            Deriving the set from \ref objFixCalls instead -- stripping exactly what the fixer
            re-issues -- looks more principled and is not equivalent. Measured over 12 mods it
            moved two: CherryHuTao gained two ``ORFix`` lines the old script does not write, and
            GanyuTwilight's ``TexFx`` sub-command changed position as a knock-on. A flag leaves

         False by default on purpose. Matching `TexFx`_ by folder deletes a mod's calls to

         :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     #. rebuilds the ``Blend.buf`` through :cpp:class:`VGRemapBlendReplace`
     #. swaps the face's diffuse and lightmap registers with :cpp:class:`RegRemap` -- the cure for
        the white cheek spots, GI 6.x having swapped which register the shader reads each out of --
        and **hides the original face section**, the one thing it hides, because a CN pair shares
        its ``tex_face_diffuse`` hash and the two would otherwise both bind
     #. drops the mod's own ``ORFix``/``NNFix`` calls and re-issues ``NNFix`` where it belongs

     .. note::
        This is **not** the shape for remapping onto a boss that shares the source's geometry --
        that keeps the source's hashes and has to hide the originals instead. Raiden has her own
