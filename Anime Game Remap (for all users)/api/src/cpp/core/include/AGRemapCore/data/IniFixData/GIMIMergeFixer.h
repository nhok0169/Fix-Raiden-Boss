     What :cpp:func:`makeGIMIMergeFixer` needs: a mod built for a skin of SEVERAL components, fixed
     onto a target of ONE :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     The inverse of :cpp:struct:`GIMIComponentFixerConfig`, and the third fixer template beside it
     and :cpp:struct:`GIMICharFixerConfig`. Where that one splits a mod's single mesh across a
     skin's components, this joins a skin's components into the target's single set of buffers --
     see :cpp:class:`VGComponentMerge` for why several ``.ini`` files binding one hash cannot do it
     @endrst

             The slot's ``match_first_index`` on the SOURCE, as a literal :raw-html:`<br />`
             :raw-html:`<br />`

             The fixer is built before the parser parses, so it finds the mod's files by hash over
             :cpp:func:`IniFile::getIfTemplates` and needs this to tell one slot's section from
             another's. Carried here rather than read from :cpp:class:`Indices` for the reason
             ``IndexData.cpp``'s own note records -- the components' slot indices are deliberately
             not in that table

             The target has no slot for one, so it is dropped and the rest shifted down

             YelanTranquil's ``Bang`` and ``Eye`` have none: the game draws both with her Body slot
             A's set. A mod may leave those sections with an ``ib`` and nothing else, and the
             remapped draw then binds no texture at all -- which is worse than untextured, because
             ``ORFix`` / ``NNFix`` re-slot whatever is bound whether or not the section bound it. A
             slot that ends up with nothing gets no fix call either

             slot's ``ib`` on disk :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             The same fallback as :cpp:member:`Component::vertexCount` and for the same reason: a
             slot the mod does not have at all gets its ``ib`` from a download, and downloads are
             fetched in ``fixResources``, AFTER the ``.ini`` file is written. A slot the mod DOES
             have is measured from its own file, so a modded mesh of a different size is unaffected
             -- one YelanTranquil edit draws 10782 indices out of a Bang the game draws 7692 from
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Only ever read for a target object SEVERAL source slots land on, which is the only
             place an index count is needed -- see :cpp:member:`Slot::to`. ``0`` means "measure it"

             The GAME model's vertex count for this component, used only when the mod does not have
             the component at all :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             A mod may simply be missing one -- an NSFW YelanTranquil edit has no ``Eye`` -- and the
             parser then hangs that component's downloads off `sections`_ it invents for it. Those
             downloads are not on disk yet when the ``.ini`` file is written: the service fetches
             them in ``fixResources``, AFTER ``IniFile::fix``. So the count that goes into ``draw``
             and ``override_vertex_count``, and the vertex offsets every later component's index
             buffers are shifted by, cannot be measured from the file here :raw-html:`<br />`
             :raw-html:`<br />`

             It does not have to be: a downloaded buffer is by definition the game's own, so its
             length is this number. A component the mod DOES have is still measured, so a modded
             mesh of a different size is unaffected :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             ``0`` means "measure it or drop the component", which is the right behaviour for a
             component that is missing AND has no download to fall back on

             .. note::
                The same number as the parse-side ``GIMIComponentParserConfig::Component::vertexCount``,

     One fixer, not one per component: the target draws through ONE set of buffer hashes, so all of

        A target of several components -- a WuWa skin onto a WuWa skin -- is NOT this function's
        shape and is deliberately left open. The pieces that would serve it are here though: the
        slots name their target object by string, and :cpp:class:`VGComponentMerge` knows nothing
        about the target at all
