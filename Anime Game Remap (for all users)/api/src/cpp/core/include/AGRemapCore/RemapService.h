    /**
     * @brief
     @rst
     The overall class for remapping mods :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     This is the **model** half of the pure-Python ``RemapService`` (``remapService.py``), merged
     with the parts of the pure-Python ``Mod`` (``model/Mod.py``) that walk a mod folder and drive
     each ``.ini`` file through it. It is deliberately *not* a literal port of either: the
     pure-Python original mixed its UI conversion in with its model logic, and everything on the UI
     side of that line -- turning the user's mod-type *names*, version *strings* and download-mode
     *strings* into real objects, printing the mods that are about to be fixed, deciding where a
     log file goes -- lives in ``RemapServiceCLI`` instead :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

     Concretely, what that split buys each attribute:

     * ``types``/``remappedTypes``/``forcedType`` were lists of user-typed mod-type *names* that the
       constructor resolved by string search (and could fail on, with an ``InvalidModType``). Here
       they are #fromModTypeIds, #toModTypeIds and #forcedModTypeIds -- sets of
       :cpp:enum:`ModTypeId` integer values, handed straight to :cpp:class:`IniFile`, which already
       indexes mod types by that same id. They follow :cpp:class:`IniFile`'s own convention for
       those sets exactly, so that handing them over is a plain pass-through: ``std::nullopt``
       means *no filter at all* (every mod type), while a present-but-**empty** set means *accept
       nothing* -- two genuinely different answers, which a bare ``std::unordered_set`` could not
       tell apart
     * ``version`` was a version *string* that the constructor parsed and could reject. Here it is
       #fromVersion, an already-parsed :cpp:class:`Version`
     * ``downloadMode`` was a download-mode *string* that the constructor searched for and could
       reject. Here it is the :cpp:enum:`DownloadMode` enum itself
     * ``defaultType`` is now #defaultModTypeIds -- a *set* of ids rather than a single
       user-typed name, and one this class never second-guesses (the original quietly discarded it
       unless ``readAllInis`` was set, and otherwise defaulted it to Raiden)
     * ``log`` and ``verbose`` are gone outright -- the first is only ever decided from user input,
       and the second is a property of the view (see :cpp:member:`BaseLogger::verbose`), not of the
       remap
     * #gameTypeIds is new, and has no pure-Python counterpart on ``RemapService`` at all --
       :cpp:class:`IniFile` needs it to narrow which games' mod types a ``.ini`` file may classify
       as, and only the caller knows which games are being remapped
     * #logger is new for the same reason the above are typed: the pure-Python original built its
       own ``Logger`` internally (from the ``log``/``verbose`` arguments it no longer takes), which
       hard-wired it to the CLI view. Here the view is handed in

     .. note::
        Because every one of those became a *type* rather than a string, none of them can be
        invalid any more, so this class has no counterpart to the pure-Python original's
        ``__errorsBeforeFix`` -- the deferred ``InvalidModType``/``InvalidDownloadMode``/``ValueError``
        it stashed away in the constructor to re-raise at fix time. Rejecting bad user input is
        ``RemapServiceCLI``'s job now, and it happens before a :cpp:class:`RemapService` is ever
        built

             **Default ``false``, ie. uncompressed** -- which is what the pure-Python original
             always did. Its `Pillow`_ engine has no BCn encoder at all, so every texture it ever
             wrote was 32-bit uncompressed; making that the default here keeps a run's speed in line
             with what users are used to, and leaves compression as something asked for
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             A **one-way override**, applied in :cpp:func:`_fixResource` right before a texture
             resource is written, and it only ever overrides compression *off*: left ``false``,
             whatever each mod type's own texture edit asked for is ignored and nothing is encoded.
             Set ``true``, nothing is overridden and each edit keeps its own answer -- which is why
             this is not simply a ``compress`` flag mirroring :cpp:func:`TexEditor::getCompress`.
             There is no reason for a run to be able to force compression *on* for an edit that
             deliberately turned it off, so ``--compressTextures`` permits compression rather than
             imposing it :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             BCn encoding is almost the entire cost of writing a texture -- roughly eight times the

             #. if the folder holds no ``.ini`` files at all, nothing is handled there -- the walk
                just enumerates what lies beneath it (#addNeighbourFolders) and moves on

                #createIni, so every one of them inherits this class's #fromModTypeIds /
                #forcedModTypeIds / #toModTypeIds / #fromVersion / #gameTypeIds / #downloadMode),
                handed to #handleIni, and then asked which folders *it* references
                (#addIniNeighbourFolders) -- **on top of** the same enumeration step, not instead
                of it

             That second half is what lets the walk follow a mod wherever its resources actually
             live, rather than only where the folder tree happens to put them: a ``.ini`` file can

             The screening is :cpp:class:`RemapIniResourceMixin`'s six questions, asked in the order
             the pure-Python original's ``Mod.handleFixFiles`` asks them, and each one exists
             because the answer is already known without doing any work:

             * ``hasRequired`` -- the resource is missing something it cannot be fixed without (the
               original's missing-``origFullPath`` branch). Recorded as skipped rather than silently
               dropped
             * ``srcIsFixed`` / ``srcEncounteredError`` -- this fix already dealt with the *source*
               file, successfully or not, on some earlier ``.ini`` file. Several ``.ini`` files can
               name the same source
             * ``fixIsFixed`` / ``fixEncounteredError`` -- likewise for the *fixed* file
             * ``fixExists``, but only under #fixOnly -- "fix without removing previous fixes" means
               a fixed file already on disk is left exactly as it is

             :raw-html:`<br />`

             A resource that is not a :cpp:class:`RemapIniResourceMixin` at all is left alone: it
             carries none of these questions and no ``fix`` this class knows how to call
             :raw-html:`<br />` :raw-html:`<br />`

             Screening and fixing are two separate passes, deliberately. The heading this writes
             before the first fix has to know whether **anything** survived screening -- announcing
             that the resources are being fixed and then silently fixing none of them reads worse
